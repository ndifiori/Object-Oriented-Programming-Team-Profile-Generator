# Object-Oriented-Programming-Team-Profile-Generator
Bootcamp Challenge 10

## Your Task

This bootcamp challenge required me to utilize object oriented programming and test driven development. This application allows a user to answer questions about potential employees that they might have. Their answers will be generated on an html page that is user friendly and will allow an employer to easily keep track of their employees. 

The technologies we used for this application is inquirer to ask the users questions in the terminal and jest to test our modules. 

I hope you enjoy this application!
